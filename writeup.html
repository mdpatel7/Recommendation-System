		<h3>Crawling Content</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I have built a web crawler in python using the beautiful soup library.	
			</li>
			<li>
				Beautiful soup parses HTML and XML documents and creates a parse tree to get data from HTML tags.	
			</li>
			<li>
				I have scraped data from Java wikibooks as well as Oracle Documents into .csv files. I have submitted two python files which crawls JavaWikibooks and Oracle documents.	
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Indexing</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I have used Amazon Web Service's ElasticSearchService which is built on top of Lucene for indexing my crawled content.	
			</li>
			<li>
				Registering with ElasticSearchService provides an API end-point which we can be used to push the crawled data.
			</li>
			<li>
				I have pushed the crawled data(both java wikibooks and Orace Docs) through the python script to the elastic search.
			</li>
			<li>
				Elasticsearch service uses Inverted Index technique which consists of collection of unique words in each document and all the documents in which that word appears. </li>
			<li>Elasticsearch applies analyzer to the textfields, results of which are 		stored in inverted index.</li>
			<li>
				Elastic search creates indices of the number of records(rows in my .csv). </li>
				<li>Index in Elastic Search is a kind of a database in MySQL.
				An Elasticsearch cluster contains Indices (databases), which in turn contain multiple Types (tables). These types hold multiple Documents (rows), and each document has Properties(columns).</li>
				
			</li>
			<li>
				I created an Ajax get query to call the ElasticSearch API and displayed the response data in my front end.</li>
